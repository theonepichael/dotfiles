"""install.py — dotfiles + AI-harness provisioner for macOS and Linux/WSL.

Ported from the zsh ``install.sh`` this repo used through mid-2026; the
shell script is now a thin bootstrap that locates a Python 3.12+ and execs
this file.

Two properties from the shell version are load-bearing and preserved here:

* **Nothing aborts the run.** There is no ``set -e`` equivalent and no
  bare ``raise`` in the install path — a blocked installer or an offline
  package mirror must not stop the steps after it. Every failure is
  collected by :class:`Reporter` and printed loudly in the end-of-run
  summary; the exit code is 1 if anything was skipped, 0 otherwise.
* **Every file mutation is recorded** to an append-only history log
  (``~/.local/state/dotfiles/history.jsonl``) that never gets truncated, so
  ``--rollback`` reverses *every* run ever recorded, not just the most
  recent one. Packages are reported but never uninstalled.

The dotfile symlink table itself lives in ``links.toml`` next to this file,
not in code — see that file's header for the per-entry schema.

Flags
  --quiet, -q    suppress non-essential output
  --verbose, -v  emit extra diagnostic messages to stderr

Requires Python 3.12+.

  --quiet, -q   suppress non-essential output
  --verbose, -v emit extra diagnostic messages to stderr
  --harness   required for an install run; not needed by the undo/audit
              actions (--rollback, --depart, --check-links), though
              --check-links accepts it to scope which entries apply.
              Comma-separated, at least one of:
              claude, copilot, opencode, agy, pi. No default — every run must
              state its intent explicitly. Purely additive: omitting a harness
              you previously selected does NOT uninstall or clean it up,
              it just skips re-provisioning it this run. Removal is a
              --rollback concern (reverses every run recorded in the
              history file, not just the most recent one) or manual cleanup.
  --profile   personal (default) or work. Controls machine-level concerns:
              excludes every personal-only managed service (watchcommit,
              opencode-skills-sync), excludes personal API-key setup, seeds
              tightened settings where a profile-specific variant exists
              (settings.work.json), and excludes opencode entirely — it is
              never installed on a work machine, regardless of --harness.
              Otherwise never restricts which harness(es) you can choose —
              --profile=work --harness=claude is honored as stated.
  --rollback  reverse every file mutation (symlinks, copies, backups) ever
              recorded across all past runs, using the history file, then
              exit. Not limited to the most recent run — running install.sh
              several times over weeks and then rolling back undoes all of
              it in one shot, oldest run included. Packages are reported
              but never uninstalled. Must be used alone (no --harness,
              --profile, or --force) — except --dry-run and --wipe, see
              below.
  --wipe      modifier for --rollback: instead of restoring the original
              pre-dotfiles files from their .bak backups, deletes the
              backups outright, so nothing dotfiles-related is left behind.
              Also sweeps untracked state the installer creates but never
              records in its history — Neovim's XDG state dirs
              (~/.local/share/nvim, ~/.local/state/nvim, ~/.cache/nvim) and,
              on Linux, every managed systemd --user service (disabled
              and stopped). These are NOT where a Neovim binary itself
              belongs — a self-contained Neovim install (its share/nvim/
              runtime tree) must live outside ~/.local/share/nvim (e.g.
              ~/.local/opt/neovim, what _install_neovim_fallback uses), or
              --wipe deletes it along with everything else here. Packages
              are still never touched. Excludes the
              macOS watchcommit launchd agent, Rectangle preferences, and
              the Caps Lock→Escape remap — no clean filesystem-delete
              equivalent for those. Requires --rollback.
  --force     override the work-profile guard on a machine previously
              provisioned with --profile=work
  --dry-run   print what every step would do without doing it: no packages
              installed, no files written/symlinked/removed, no history
              written. Detection (what's already installed, which
              profile/harness branches apply) still runs for real, so the
              preview reflects actual machine state. The one flag allowed
              alongside --rollback, to preview an undo before running it.
  --no-nvim-pin  Linux only. By default, _install_neovim_fallback always
              ends up with ~/.local/bin/nvim pinned to
              NEOVIM_FALLBACK_VERSION, even when the distro's own neovim
              package already clears the 0.11 floor — reproducible across
              machines regardless of what apt/dnf happens to ship. This
              flag restores the old rescue-only behavior: the fallback is
              only installed when the neovim on PATH is missing, too old,
              or has a broken runtime; a distro package that's merely
              "good enough" is left alone rather than overridden.
  --reseed    force an overwrite of drifted copy-once seeds (VS Code
              settings.json/keybindings.json, Claude Code settings.json,
              opencode.jsonc, Pi settings.json) with the repo's current
              version, instead of only reporting drift. The pre-existing
              file is backed up to
              <name>.bak once, the first time a given file is reseeded;
              later reseeds of the same file reuse that backup rather than
              overwriting it again. Cannot be combined with --rollback.
  --adopt     copy every drifted live copy-once seed back into the repository
              (the reverse of --reseed), scoped to the selected harnesses and
              WSL VS Code files. The repo seed must be tracked and clean;
              adoption creates no backup or history entry and leaves the seed
              dirty by design, so commit it before adopting another edit.
              Missing live files are left missing. Empty, unreadable, dirty,
              untracked, or unparseable opencode.jsonc files are skipped;
              live opencode allowlist bypasses are refused. Cannot be combined
              with --reseed, --rollback, --depart, or --check-links.
  --depart    remove or restore everything a past install run (future
              installs only — this reasons entirely from a baseline
              recorded at install time, not from history.jsonl) owns on
              this machine: files, symlinks, packages, runtimes, and
              services. Must be used alone — the only other flags allowed
              alongside it are --yes and --dry-run. Refuses with no baseline
              recorded (exit 2). Prints a full preflight report and, on a
              real (non-dry-run) run, requires typing the exact token
              DEPART to proceed unless --yes is passed. This is
              local-footprint cleanup, not forensic erasure — see README.md
              for the separate, genuinely destructive WSL unregister/
              recreate path for a guaranteed pristine reset.
  --yes       skip --depart's interactive confirmation prompt. Only valid
              alongside --depart.
  --check-links
              audit the live symlinks against links.toml and exit. Strictly
              read-only: nothing is created, removed, or repointed, so this
              is safe to run at any time. Reports several buckets —
              broken-source (the link is correct but its repo file is
              gone), wrong-target (the link points somewhere other than
              links.toml says), not-a-symlink (a real file sits where a
              link belongs), orphaned (a symlink an earlier run recorded
              in the history that no links.toml entry produces anymore,
              e.g. the entry was deleted or its dest renamed), and
              unmanaged (a file sitting in a directory links.toml declares
              exclusive via a [[managed_dir]] row, that no [[link]] row
              produces) — none of which a plain re-run surfaces, since
              symlink() happily creates a dangling link and never revisits
              a dest that links.toml stopped mentioning. --harness and
              --profile scope which entries are considered; with no
              --harness, every harness's entries are checked, which cannot
              produce false positives because every bucket requires the
              destination to already exist on disk. Links pointing at the
              same file in a different checkout of this repo — the normal
              state of affairs when auditing from a worktree — are
              collapsed into a single informational note instead of one
              finding each, and do not affect the exit code. --report-
              uninstalled additionally reports never-installed: an
              applicable row whose repo source exists but whose
              destination was never linked here at all, as opposed to one
              that was linked once and later removed, which stays silent
              either way; off by default, since a machine that simply
              hasn't run install.sh yet for some entries is not a defect.
              No other flag may be combined with --check-links.
              Exits 0 when nothing is wrong, 1 when any bucket is
              non-empty, 2 if links.toml itself cannot be read.

Examples:
  ./install.sh --harness=claude
  ./install.sh --profile=work --harness=copilot
  ./install.sh --harness=claude,opencode
  ./install.sh --harness=claude,agy
  ./install.sh --dry-run --harness=claude
  ./install.sh --dry-run --rollback
  ./install.sh --rollback --wipe        # full rollback to a blank slate
  ./install.sh --check-links            # read-only symlink audit
  ./install.sh --check-links --report-uninstalled  # also flag never-installed links

Exits 0 if every step ran, 1 if any step was skipped (see summary)."""
