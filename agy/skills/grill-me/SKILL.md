name: grill-me
description: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design until reaching shared understanding, resolving each branch of the decision tree. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan, get grilled on their design, or mentions "grill me".
---

All session state lives in JSON under `~/.claude/data/grill/`, mutated only through
`python3 ~/.claude/scripts/grill.py` — never write or edit session files by hand.
The plan document is a separate markdown artifact **you author yourself**, informed
by the recorded decision points.

```
grill.py new '{"topic": "..."}'                          # start session, prints slug
grill.py ask '{"id", "question", ["reasoning"]}'         # register an open decision point
grill.py decide '{"id", "decision", ["question"], ["source"]}'  # resolve one
grill.py revise <id> '{"decision": "..."}'               # amend (resets its verdict)
grill.py verdict <id> '{"result", "evidence"}'           # record verification result
grill.py plan <path>                                     # record plan artifact location
grill.py next / render / show / list                     # resume point / status / raw JSON
```

All commands default to the most recent session; pass `--session <slug>` otherwise.
Mutations echo what they did on stderr — check it matches your intent.

**Pin the session.** The moment you have a slug — from `new`'s stdout, or from
`list`/`next` when resuming — pass `--session <slug>` on every subsequent
`ask`/`decide`/`revise`/`verdict` call for the rest of the conversation. Never rely
on the default-most-recent resolution past that first call: a concurrent grill
session elsewhere (another terminal, another agent) can become "most recent"
between calls and silently redirect a bare call at the wrong session's decisions.
This has actually happened — a `decide` meant for one session landed on a
different one that happened to be more recently touched.

## Default mode

If the user didn't name a specific topic (and isn't asking for verification or
autonomous resolution), grill the plan under discussion when the conversation
makes it obvious; otherwise ask the user what to grill before proceeding.
`--verify` and autonomous/"grill this on your own" runs each follow their own
section below instead of this Q&A loop.

**Pre-step: orient before asking.**
Check what codebase context is already in scope from prior exploration. Do a targeted read/grep only for files directly relevant to the topic that haven't been read yet. Don't re-crawl what's already known. Never ask a question the codebase already answers.

Also check the vitals store for already-settled facts on this topic before asking about it: read `~/.claude/data/grill/vitals/_global.json` (and `~/.claude/data/grill/vitals/<backlog-slug>.json` too, if this session is tied to a backlog item and that file exists) and skim `text`/`reasoning` fields for anything relevant — no keyword filter, judge relevance directly. Treat a matching record as a settled fact: don't re-ask a question it already answers, and cite it (`source_slug`/`source_decision_id`) if it informs a new decision. Skip this check entirely if the vitals directory doesn't exist yet — nothing has been promoted.

Then check `grill.py list` for an existing session matching the topic. If one matches, resume it — `grill.py next` picks up at the first open question; tell the user you're resuming. Only `grill.py new` when nothing matches or the user says "start over".

**Q&A loop:**

1. Identify the top-level decisions and unknowns. Register each one immediately with `ask` (id + question) so nothing is lost if the session is cut short. Order by dependency — resolve blockers before dependent decisions. New decision points surfaced by later answers get `ask`ed as they appear.

2. Ask one question at a time, applying the shared instructions file's convention for asking the user to choose.

3. When the user answers:
   - If the answer is consistent and resolves the question, record it — `decide` with source `user` — and move to the next.
   - If the answer is vague, push back and ask them to be specific.
   - If the answer introduces inconsistencies or new risks, name them and keep drilling.
   - If the user defers ("whatever you think", "you decide"), record your recommendation via `decide` with source `defaulted`.
   - If you can settle the question yourself by running actual code (a scoped script, existing tests, a REPL check) rather than asking, do that first and record it — `decide` with source `tested`, noting what you ran and observed in the reasoning field. Cite the specific file, function, constant, or line checked — not just that a check happened. This is distinct from `user` (the person didn't state it) and from `--verify` mode (which re-checks decisions after the fact) — it's confirming a decision inline, during the Q&A loop itself. Once `decide` is recorded, immediately follow with `grill.py verdict <id> '{"result": "VERIFIED", "evidence": "..."}'` using the same observation just gathered — don't leave the check recorded only in reasoning; the evidence string should restate what was actually run or checked, not just repeat the decision.

4. A branch is resolved when the answer generates no new questions. Keep drilling until every open question is decided. Two distinct early exits — the user's words pick which:
   - **Pause** ("let's stop here", "I need to step away", "we'll come back to this", or a forced interruption cutting the session short) — stop without deciding anything. Open questions stay open for a later resume; no plan is written. Offer a backlog item per the shared instructions file's proactive-capture protocol: session slug in `context`, `next_steps` pointing at `grill.py next`.
   - **Wrap up** ("wrap it up", "just finish it", "that's enough") — `decide` each remaining open question with your best-guess answer and source `assumed`, then conclude normally.

**End of session** (fully decided or wrapped up — not on pause):

1. Author the plan as a markdown document — a real plan someone could execute, not a decision log. The recorded decision points (`grill.py show`) inform it. Plans always live centrally at `~/.claude/data/grill/<slug>-plan.md` — never in project repos; this is personal tooling, not team-facing docs.
2. Run `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/vitals_promotion.py --apply` (mechanical, no new flags needed — this re-runs the full classify/promote/supersede pass over every session, not just this one, so it also catches drift from sessions closed since the last run). Show the printed report (promoted/superseded/needs-review counts) to the user in plain text; if `promoted_count` or `superseded_count` is nonzero, this session's activity changed the vitals store the next session's pre-step will read.
3. Record it: `grill.py plan <path>`.
4. Show the user the plan and the `grill.py render` output (decision table, any open questions, verification state).
5. Check whether any decided item has no recorded verdict, regardless of source. Tally the no-verdict set by source — `defaulted`/`assumed` (nobody confirmed these) vs `user` (a human stated it, but the claim itself was never checked) vs `tested` (rare here, since step 3 already auto-verdicts these inline) — and offer, in plain text, with the breakdown visible: "N decision(s) have no recorded verdict — X defaulted/assumed, Y user-stated — want me to run --verify on them before we call this done?" Proceed into `--verify` mode only if the user says yes; otherwise the session ends here as-is.
6. Once verification (if any) is settled, always offer clear-and-go, in plain text — ask whether to clear context and start executing the plan now. On yes, run `grill.py mark-pending-execution` (defaults to this session), then tell the user: "Marked — start a fresh session whenever you're ready and ask me to pick the plan back up." agy has no `SessionStart`-equivalent hook event (confirmed: `hooks.md` lists only `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`PreInvocation`/`PostInvocation`/`Stop`) to auto-surface the marked plan, so resume is manual: when a session opens with the user asking to resume/execute the marked plan, run `grill.py pending-plan --consume` and act on the printed instructions (resume if the user says go/continue, otherwise leave the cleared flag alone). On no, nothing else happens, no state change.

## `--verify` mode

Run this after a default-mode session, when the user explicitly asks to verify a grilled plan. It does not ask new questions — it tests each decision against reality.

1. Load state with `grill.py render` (most recent session by default, `--session` otherwise). Do not ask the user to re-state decisions. Decisions still open must be decided in a default-mode pass first.

2. For each decided row — `defaulted` and `assumed` first, since no human confirmed those — design and run a non-destructive experiment to test whether the decision holds: run relevant tests, write and execute a scoped throwaway script, invoke existing CLI/dev tools. Observe actual behavior. (Shell use beyond grill.py isn't pre-approved here; permission prompts for experiments are expected.) `tested` rows are lowest priority — they already carry inline run-time evidence — but are still fair game for a spot re-check.

3. Record each result with `grill.py verdict <id> '{"result": ..., "evidence": ...}'`:
   - **VERIFIED** — experiment confirms the decision holds. Evidence: what was run, what was observed.
   - **DISPUTED** — experiment contradicts it. Evidence: exactly what was found and why it conflicts.
   - **UNVERIFIABLE** — no experiment can test this yet (e.g. code doesn't exist). State why.

4. For any DISPUTED decision: re-grill the user, record the new answer with `grill.py revise <id>` (this resets the verdict), then re-run the experiment and record a fresh verdict. Repeat until nothing is DISPUTED.

5. If any decisions changed, update the plan artifact to match, then show the final `grill.py render`.

## Autonomous mode (no live user Q&A)

For grilling a topic (or a batch of backlog items) with no live user Q&A — the
user has explicitly asked for autonomous resolution, e.g. "grill the rest of the
backlog on your own." Every decision in this mode is unconfirmed by a human, so
it trades interactivity for adversarial rigor instead of just guessing.

1. Same pre-step and `ask`-registration as default mode — identify and register
   every decision point up front.

2. For each open question, instead of asking the user: form your own leading
   answer, then run the second-opinion skill's iteration loop (same
   convergence rule and round cap — reuse that backend and loop rather than
   inventing a separate critique mechanism) against a short write-up of the
   question, your answer, and enough surrounding context for an outside
   model to attack it credibly. "Adversarial" here means exactly what
   `second_opinion.py`'s own `CRITIQUE_PROMPT` already asks for — find
   problems rather than summarize or agree, name what's underspecified or
   assumed without justification, disagree explicitly where warranted, and
   propose a simpler approach if one exists; a critique that just restates
   or praises your answer isn't adversarial and doesn't count as a round.
   Record the surviving answer with `decide` and source `assumed` —
   summarize the critique exchange (what was challenged, what survived, what
   changed) in `reasoning`, since that's the only record of how the decision
   was actually stress-tested.

3. Batch topics (a backlog list) run this per-item, each as its own session.

4. End-of-session is otherwise identical to default mode's — author the plan,
   record it, show it — except the `--verify` offer is not optional here: every
   decision in an autonomous session is `assumed` by construction, so always run
   `--verify` immediately afterward rather than asking first, and say so plainly
   in the plan's header (topic, "resolved via adversarial critique — no live
   user Q&A", and that verify then ran against it).
