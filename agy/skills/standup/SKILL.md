name: standup
description: "Gather assigned work, chat signal, calendar events, pending replies, git commits, and backlog activity into a daily standup draft, saved to a dated file. Use when the user says 'standup', 'prep for standup', or wants their daily status pulled together."
---

Read-only against every external system. Never comments on a ticket, posts a
message, or marks anything read — the only write is the standup file itself.
No autonomous scanning: this only runs when invoked.

## 1. Fetch

```
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/standup.py fetch [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

`--date` overrides the reference date (defaults to today) — use it after a
gap longer than one working day (holiday, PTO) where the default
last-working-day boundary would land on the wrong day.

Returns one JSON object: `date`, `since` (the computed time boundary every
windowed source used), `git_commits`, `backlog_in_progress`,
`backlog_recent_done`, `assigned_items`, `messages`, `chat_thread_updates`,
`email_correspondence`, `email_thread_updates`, `calendar_events`
(yesterday's and today's, non-recurring only), `pending_items_open`,
`previous_standup` (most recent saved standup file before `date`, or
`null`), `skipped`. `chat_thread_updates`/`email_thread_updates` are
targeted fetches against threads already in `pending_items_open` — don't
rely on `messages`/`email_correspondence` alone to catch a reply to a
tracked item.

`pending_items_open` is a read-only view of `dev_status.py`'s canonical
pending-items store — `standup.py` never mutates it; all pending-item writes
below go through `dev_status.py`.

`skipped` lists every source that couldn't run (adapter not yet configured,
no git repos set up, `work_backlog_prefixes` missing, etc.) with a reason.
Tell the user what was skipped and why — don't silently produce a partial
standup as if it were complete. See `~/dotfiles/claude/scripts/standup_adapters.py`
for wiring in a real adapter once a source is consistently skipped because
the platform is now known.

## 2. Reconcile pending items

Apply the shared instructions file's pending-item status-transition rule
(one step at a time, never jump straight to `resolved`). For each entry in
`pending_items_open`, check `chat_thread_updates` / `email_thread_updates`
(and `messages`/`email_correspondence` for anything those targeted fetches
missed) for a reply. Propose the transition to the user in chat first —
nothing gets written until they confirm, since "was this actually answered"
is a judgment call, not a pattern match. Only move an item to `resolved`
when the user confirms it's actually done, and record the `outcome`.

For anything in the fetched data that looks like a new item worth tracking
across days (an email/chat message still awaiting a reply, an access
request not yet approved) but isn't already in `pending_items_open`,
propose adding it per the shared instructions file's pending-item protocol.

`<id>` can be the pending item's slug — `dev_status.py`'s cross-section
numbering (visible via the dashboard skill) also works, but its numbers shift as
items change, so prefer the slug here since `standup.py`'s `fetch` output
already gives you it directly.

## 3. Draft

Write the standup update from the reconciled data. Ground "what I did
yesterday" in `previous_standup`'s content when present — it's what was
actually committed to, not a re-derivation from raw signal — supplemented
by `git_commits`/`backlog_recent_done`. Cover what's in progress
(`backlog_in_progress`, `assigned_items`), anything noteworthy on the
calendar (`calendar_events` — yesterday's and today's, already filtered to
non-recurring), and anything still blocked (`pending_items_open`,
post-reconciliation). Skip a section entirely if its source had nothing or
was skipped — don't pad the draft to look complete.

## 4. Save and show

Write the draft to `~/.claude/data/standup/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today's date).
Show the user the draft and the `skipped` list from step 1.
