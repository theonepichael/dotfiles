name: second-opinion
description: Send a plan to a non-Claude model for adversarial critique, then iterate — revise, re-send, repeat — until the critique stops surfacing anything new or a round cap is hit. Use when the user wants a second opinion, an outside critique, or to stress-test a plan against a different model.
---

All backend I/O goes through `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/second_opinion.py` —
never shell out to `agy`/`opencode` directly. It is single-round: one call, one
critique. The multi-round loop and plan revision are your job, not the script's.

```
second_opinion.py detect                        # which backends are present (JSON)
second_opinion.py review <plan-file-or-text> \
    [--focus-file <path>]                        # one critique from the
                                                  # priority-selected backend,
                                                  # optionally scoped with
                                                  # plan-specific risk hints
```

`--model-index N` (optional) is a 0-based index into a per-machine model
pool (`SECOND_OPINION_AGY_MODEL_POOL` / `_OPENCODE_MODEL_POOL` /
`_COPILOT_MODEL_POOL`, set by the user). `agy` now shares the indexed-pool
contract: an explicit index selects an entry from `SECOND_OPINION_AGY_MODEL_POOL`
for that call, just like opencode/copilot, even when a single-model override
is also set; without `--model-index` the single override (or the default
`Gemini 3.7 Flash (High)`) applies. An explicit index is a hard error if the
selected backend's pool is unset/empty or the index is out of range — it no
longer silently falls back. Automatic selection tries backends in fixed
priority `[agy, opencode, copilot]` and stops on the first candidate with a
pool config error, so name a pool-configured backend explicitly with
`--backend <backend>` when the first priority candidate lacks a pool.

## Resolving the target plan

If the user named a specific file path or pasted plan text, treat that as the
target. Otherwise infer it: prefer `grill.py show`'s most recent session
`plan_path` if one exists, otherwise the plan or proposal visible in the
current conversation. If neither exists, ask the user what to review.

Whenever the resolved plan has no backing file yet — pasted text, or the
"visible in the current conversation" fallback — write it to
`~/.claude/data/grill/<topic-slug>-plan.md` first, the same central location
`grill.py` plans use (never a per-session scratch dir — it can be gone by the
time anything references this path later, e.g. a `dev_status.py`
`related_files` entry read back in a future session). Use that path as
`current_plan` for the rest of this skill. Never pass inline plan text to
`second_opinion.py review`, and never embed full plan text into a prose field
meant for short descriptions (a `context`/`next_steps`/note field on a
`dev_status.py` item, etc.) — reference the file path there instead.

## Deriving focus hints

Before each `review` call, read `current_plan` and identify 2-3 short,
concrete risk areas specific to *this* plan's content — not generic advice
("test your code", "handle errors") but what's actually likely to go wrong
given what the plan does (e.g. "concurrent writes during the migration
window", "auth token refresh on the retry path", "the fallback UI state
when the API times out"). Write them as a short bullet list to
`<current_plan without its extension>-focus.md` and pass
`--focus-file <that path>` to `review`. Skip `--focus-file` entirely if
nothing plan-specific stands out — never write generic filler bullets just
to have something to pass.

This is a fresh judgment call each round, not a one-time setup step: the
plan changes between rounds (see the revision step below), so the risk
areas can shift too. The focus file is working scratch, like the plan
itself mid-loop — it supplements the reviewer's prompt, it doesn't replace
any of it, and it isn't a deliverable: don't add it to a backlog item's
`related_files` (that's for the final plan and critique-notes file only,
per the section below).

The point of these hints is to sharpen the critique on this plan's actual
risk surface, not to narrow the reviewer's attention to only what you
anticipated — the reviewer still receives the full generic adversarial
prompt regardless, so it stays free to surface things you didn't think to
flag.

## Iteration loop

```
round = 1
current_plan = <resolved input>
prior_critique = None

loop:
    focus_hints = derive 2-3 plan-specific risk bullets from current_plan
                  (see above), or skip if nothing specific stands out
    critique = second_opinion.py review <current_plan> \
                   [--focus-file <focus-hints-path>]   # one call
    show "Round N critique" + critique in chat

    if round > 1 and critique raises nothing substantively
       new vs prior_critique:
        stop — CONVERGED

    if round == 3:
        stop — CAPPED, converged_or_not = (no new issues this round)

    current_plan = revise current_plan yourself, addressing
                   valid points from the critique. For any point you
                   reject, append a brief "Rejected feedback" note to
                   current_plan stating what was suggested and why —
                   the reviewer is called statelessly each round, so
                   without this it will just repeat the same rejected
                   suggestion instead of engaging with your reasoning.
    prior_critique = critique
    round += 1

show the final revised plan + a round-by-round summary of what changed and why
```

"Raises nothing substantively new" is your judgment call, made by reading both
critiques side by side — not delegated to the reviewer model or to
deterministic code. A repeated suggestion you already rejected (and noted as
rejected) does not count as new.

Round-by-round narration inline in the plan while the loop is running —
"Rejected feedback" notes, "changed in round N" framing, per-round
"critique point X" cross-references — is legitimate working scratch: the
reviewer is called statelessly each round, so without some record it will
just repeat what you already addressed. But before the plan is shown as
final or saved to disk (converged or capped), do one cleanup pass: move all
of it out of the plan into a separate critique-notes file, written to
`<current_plan without its extension>-critique-notes.md` (e.g.
`~/.claude/data/grill/<topic-slug>-plan-critique-notes.md`) — a
round-by-round record of what was raised each round, what changed in
response, and the rejected-feedback rationale. Then rewrite each affected
step in the plan itself to state the final decision plainly, as if it had
been correct from the start, and drop any trailing per-round changelog
section. Downstream tooling (`dev_status.py` `related_files`, a future
executor session, `grill.py plan_path`) reads the plan file as *the* plan —
the critique history is a companion artifact, not inline noise in it.

## On convergence

Show the final revised plan and the summary, and save both files: the
cleaned-up plan and the critique-notes file described above. If the plan
came from an existing file (e.g. a `grill.py` `plan_path`), confirm before
overwriting it — apply the shared instructions file's convention for asking
the user to choose: overwrite (recommended) or leave as-is. Never silently
rewrite a file. The critique-notes file is new each run, so it doesn't need
the same overwrite confirmation.

## On cap-out without convergence

State plainly, distinct from a converged finish:

```
Stopped after 3 rounds — not converged.
Unresolved: <specific remaining disagreement>.
```

Then apply the shared instructions file's convention for asking the user to
choose: keep your approach (recommended), use the reviewer's suggestion, or
let the user decide manually. Never silently pick a side when the round cap
is hit mid-disagreement.

## Recording it in the backlog

Once the final plan is settled (converged or capped out), apply the shared
instructions file's "Plans and deliverables get a path on record" backlog
policy: both the plan's file path and the critique-notes file path end up in
a tracking item's `related_files`, whether that means creating the item
(offer first) or updating an existing one.

## No backend available

`second_opinion.py review` exits nonzero with a clear message when neither
`agy` nor `opencode` is on `PATH`, or when the available backend(s) fail
(e.g. the `adversary` agent errors out — check with
`opencode run --agent adversary --auto --format json <text> 2>&1` if that
happens). Relay that message and stop — don't retry or fall back to
critiquing the plan yourself.
