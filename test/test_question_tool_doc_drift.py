"""Guards the Pi question-tool capability facts across the repo.

`pi/extensions/question-tool.ts` supplies a structured multi-choice
``question`` tool for interactive Pi sessions. Several repo files were
written before it landed and still claim the opposite -- that Pi has no
structured-choice mechanism and so must ask enumerable questions in plain
text. `claude/global-instructions.md` is read by every harness (symlinked to
each harness's instruction file), so the stale claim was the worst offender;
the hand-maintained `pi/prompts/*.md` ports repeated it.

Why these assertions look where they do:

* The global-instructions check parses the actual sentence that carries the
  claim -- the "harnesses without one (...)" parenthetical in the
  Judgment-calls section -- and compares the *set* of harness names, not
  exact prose, so harmless editorial changes (reordering, rephrasing) don't
  false-positive. A break here after a *legitimate* change (e.g. Copilot
  gains a widget) is a feature: the list should be updated consciously.
* opencode legitimately contains the string "`question` tool", so the
  global-instructions check keys on the parenthetical and on Pi appearing
  *outside* it, never on a whole-file grep.
* `make-skill.md` intentionally keeps plain text as the default for
  *authored* skills: they live in `agy/skills/` and are read by agy as
  well as Pi, so a skill must not depend on a widget only Pi has. The
  check therefore guards the *justification* (agy-sharing, hedged "at
  present"), not the plain-text guidance itself.
