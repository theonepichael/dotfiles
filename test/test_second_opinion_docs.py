"""Keep the second-opinion guidance copies in sync.

The second-opinion contract lives in five hand-maintained copies
(claude/commands/second-opinion.md plus four sibling skill/command forms).
They have drifted before and each drift caused a real bug. This test asserts
every copy still carries the required contract markers, so a future edit to
one copy that forgets the model-pool rotation / no-pool safety net fails
loudly here. The single-source generator (meta-second-opinion-single-source)
is meant to replace these copies eventually; until then this holds the line.
