description: "Author or revise an opencode skill (SKILL.md) using a trigger/structure/steering/pruning rubric. Use when the user wants to create a new skill, improve or simplify an existing one, or complains a skill isn't triggering or isn't being followed."

Work through these steps in order. Don't draft the skill body before step 1 is decided.

## 1. Trigger — decide how it starts

Ask (or infer and confirm): model-invoked, user-invoked, or both?

- **Model-invoked** costs context in every session and can silently not fire; it buys hands-off convenience. **User-invoked** is reliable and cheap but the user must remember it exists.
- The frontmatter `description` IS the model-invoke surface. Write it as: what the skill does + "use when" + the literal phrases the user actually says (steal them from real transcripts). For user-invoked-only skills, keep the description one terse line.

## 2. Structure — steps, then reference

- The body is a **procedure**: numbered/ordered steps in imperative voice, addressed to the agent.
- Supporting material (schemas, long examples, lookup tables) does NOT go in the body. Put it in `~/.config/opencode/skills/ref/<skill>-<topic>.md` and point to it from the step that needs it: "Read `~/.config/opencode/skills/ref/...` when X."
- Keep the body under ~50 lines. If it branches into genuinely different workflows, split into separate skills instead of one branching monster — smaller skills also hide the end goal, which stops the agent from rushing past planning/questioning steps. (Splitting isn't the only way: grill-me gets the same effect inside one skill by forbidding plan-writing until every question is decided. Don't split a skill that demonstrably works.)

## 3. Steering — make it stick

- Use dense, industry-standard terms that carry priors ("vertical slice", "copy-once", "idempotent") instead of paragraphs of description. Pick words that *name the behavior you want*: the agent repeats them in its thinking and output, and every repetition re-anchors it on that behavior — that echo loop is what step 4 listens for.
- State the failure mode you're preventing as a direct instruction ("Pass the integer directly — do not look up the slug").

## 4. Verify in a fresh session

Probe with headless runs: `opencode -p '<a real trigger phrase>'` for model-invoke, `opencode -p '/<name> <args>'` for behavior. Check the output (and reasoning, if visible) repeats your leading words back. If the agent skips a step, that step needs splitting or stronger steering — not more prose.

## 5. Plumbing (house convention)

1. Create the repo file at `~/dotfiles/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and the skill body.
2. Add a `[[link]]` entry (`src = "opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md"`, `dest = "~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md"`, `harness = "opencode"`) in `links.toml` next to the existing ones.
3. Create the live symlink now: `ln -s ~/dotfiles/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
   Discovery is automatic — opencode picks up any `SKILL.md` under `~/.config/opencode/skills/` with no enabling config — but a skill dropped straight into the live path without steps 1–2 won't reproduce on other machines. The repo file + `links.toml` entry is what makes it reproducible; discovery alone is not reproducibility.
4. Conventional commit, scope `skills`: `feat` for a new skill, `refactor`/`docs` for revisions.

## 6. Pruning (every revision, not just creation)

- **Single source of truth**: never restate what AGENTS.md or another skill already says — point to it.
- **Remove sediment**: delete references to scripts, paths, or behaviors that no longer exist.
- **Deletion test**: if a paragraph looks decorative, remove it and rerun the step-4 probe. Identical behavior → it was a no-op; keep it deleted.
