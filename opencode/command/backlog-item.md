description: "Runs a dev_status.py backlog item end-to-end: resolve, worktree, spec (escalating to grill-me only for a genuinely open design branch), second-opinion critique, execution handoff, TDD implement, verify, commit/merge/push gates, review+approve. Use when the user says 'work on backlog item 4', 'pick up <slug>', 'let's do the next backlog item', or otherwise names a specific item to work end-to-end. Add --auto (optionally with a slug) for an unattended single-item or full-READY-batch run — commit and merge/push gates still stop live, per item."
---

Work the named item to done, one step at a time. `$ARGUMENTS` holds the
invocation: strip a leading `--auto` token if present (note that it was
given) — what remains is the target item, a slug or an integer N. If
`--auto` was given, skip straight to the `--auto mode` section at the end
of this file instead of running the numbered steps live. Otherwise, if the
remaining target is empty, ask the user which item — never guess. Every
user-approval gate below (`## 10`, `## 11`) stops and waits for the user —
never collapse two gates into one approval. Distinct from those: the item's
own `gate` field in `dev_status.py` (step 5, step 12) is a judgment-step
verification checkpoint, not a user-approval stop — same word, different
mechanism, don't conflate them.

## 1. Resolve
`python3 ~/.claude/scripts/dev_status.py show $ARGUMENTS`. Read the full
record — never start from the dashboard's one-line summary (CLAUDE.md).
Empty context/next_steps/related_files: stop and ask the user to fill them
in; don't fabricate a plan from the title. Numeric id: note the rendered rev
for `--if-rev` on the next mutating call. related_files already names a
grill plan (`~/.claude/data/grill/<slug>-plan.md`) or a spec
(`~/.claude/data/grill/<slug>-spec.md`)? Planning and critique (steps 5–6)
are already done — skip to step 8. Worktree already has
implemented, uncommitted changes (e.g. handed back from an external
executor)? Skip straight to step 9.

## 2. Start
If not already in-progress: `dev_status.py start $ARGUMENTS` (`--if-rev <N>`
for numeric ids).

## 3. Branch
related_files names exactly one project repo → worktree it per CLAUDE.md's
Git section: `git -C <repo> worktree add ../<repo-name>-<slug> -b <slug>`.
Reuse a worktree this session already made for this item instead of a
second one. Multiple repos, or none: ask which repo — never guess.

## 4. Baseline
Run that repo's test suite (or the most relevant targeted subset) in the
fresh worktree before touching anything (CLAUDE.md's "Baseline tests before
starting code work").

## 5. Spec or plan
Load the `spec` skill via opencode's native skill tool
(`skill({ name: "spec" })`) with the item's context/next_steps as the task.
Let it draft and save the spec end-to-end (its steps 1–4) — including its
own internal escalation to `grill-me` if a field's design is genuinely
open; `spec`'s step 3 owns that handoff and the resume-after entirely,
there is nothing to orchestrate here. Decline spec's own step 4 generation
offer — step 7 below owns the handoff decision.

Once spec records its artifact path, add it to the item's related_files if
missing (CLAUDE.md's "Plans and deliverables get a path on record"). If
`spec` delegated into `grill-me` along the way, that session's `plan_path`
is already cited from the spec's Context field — don't also record it as a
second, competing artifact.

Once spec is saved, add its path to the item's related_files if missing
(CLAUDE.md's "Plans and deliverables get a path on record").

### Architecture capture (new modules only)

If the artifact's related_files point into a module with no
`docs/architecture/{module-slug}.md` yet in the target repo — a genuinely
new module, not routine work in an existing one; judgment call, ask if
unclear — run one more pass before continuing: draft a 300–600 word doc
covering the module's boundary/responsibility (one paragraph), key
interfaces it exposes or consumes, explicit non-goals, and known
unknowns/deferred decisions. Save it to `docs/architecture/{module-slug}.md`
in the target repo (project documentation, not `~/.claude/data/grill/`) and
reference it from the spec/plan. A later item touching the same module cites
the existing doc instead of repeating this pass — check for it first.

### Gate classification

Once the spec/plan is recorded (and after architecture capture, if it ran),
classify its concrete implementation steps: **mechanical** (a rote,
unambiguous transformation — no interpretation needed) or **judgment**
(interprets a requirement, makes a design choice, or has ambiguous
acceptance criteria). If any step is judgment, set the item's gate before
continuing:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/dev_status.py gate-set <slug|N> '{"required": true, "criteria": ["<short imperative criterion per judgment step>", "..."]}'
```

If every step is mechanical, leave the gate unset (inert by default) —
don't call `gate-set` for a step breakdown with no judgment calls in it.

## 6. Critique
If step 5 set a gate (judgment steps present), run the `second-opinion`
skill (same skill tool, `skill({ name: "second-opinion" })`) against the
resulting plan or spec file unconditionally, no ask — critique it before
committing to an executor. If step 5 left the gate unset (all steps
mechanical), skip this step; a critique adds nothing to a rote
transformation.

## 7. Handoff
Decide who implements the plan — ask if it isn't already obvious from the
conversation:
- **Same session, now.** Trivial/small item → go to step 8 immediately.
- **Fresh opencode session.** Now run `grill.py mark-pending-execution
  --backlog-slug <slug>` (the plan's session, with this item's slug — not
  its own resolved-topic slug) and tell the user to start a fresh session
  and type `/backlog-item <slug|N>`. opencode has no SessionStart hook to
  auto-surface the marked plan (the hooks→plugin port is still deferred), so
  the typed command IS the resume path — step 1 sees the plan in
  related_files and skips to step 8.
- **Different/cheaper model.** Confirm the model actually exists in
  opencode's catalog (`opencode models`) before invoking — don't assume the
  version number is right, dictation has flubbed it before. From the
  worktree, hand off non-interactively: `opencode run --auto -m
  <provider/model> "Implement <plan path> exactly as written — TDD, run the
  full suite, then STOP without committing and report the diff."`
  (`--auto` is required — without it, opencode auto-rejects its own
  tool-call permission requests in headless mode and silently makes no
  progress). An external executor never gets the commit gate. Once it
  reports back, review — that resumes at step 9.

## 8. Red, green
TDD in the worktree: a failing test that proves the gap the plan names,
then the minimal implementation.

## 9. Verify
Run the full suite (and lint, if present) in the worktree and show the
output — "should work" is not verification (CLAUDE.md).

## 10. Gate: commit
Show the full diff. Stop — `question` tool for explicit commit approval. No
exceptions for being mid-pipeline, and no exception for code an external
executor wrote (CLAUDE.md).

## 11. Gate: commit-then-land
On approval, commit (conventional format) — this gate is never bundled with
what follows. Personal project (this repo, a personal side project — never
a `work-`-prefixed item or a work repo): offer the follow-on sequence as one
bundled question (CLAUDE.md's Git section) — "merge to main, push, and
clean up the worktree?" — then merge locally, push, `git worktree remove`,
`git branch -d` on that single approval. Work-related or ambiguous: ask
separately for merge and for push — never bundle.

**`git worktree remove` fails with "Directory not empty"?** A dev server
(or other long-running process) launched against this worktree during step
9 — e.g. via the `run` skill's smoke-check pattern — can outlive the port
kill that pattern documents: killing the port's listener doesn't always
reap a wrapper's child process (a `bun run dev` parent whose `node .../next
dev` child keeps the worktree as its cwd). `git worktree remove` then fails
partway, and can strip the worktree's git-admin metadata (it drops out of
`git worktree list`) while leaving the directory on disk — a second
`remove` won't find it. Find what's still holding it open with `lsof +D
<worktree-path>`, `kill` those exact PIDs (never a broad `pkill -f` — it
can match unrelated processes, including the agent's own), then remove the
orphaned directory directly (`rm -rf <worktree-path>`) and retry
`git branch -d`.

## 12. Close
`dev_status.py review $ARGUMENTS` then `approve $ARGUMENTS` — never a bare
`done` on an in-review item. If `approve` refuses citing an unmet gate,
actually check each criterion from `show $ARGUMENTS` against the diff —
don't pass it reflexively — then `dev_status.py gate-pass $ARGUMENTS` and
retry `approve`. Display the full dashboard stdout these print; don't just
narrate a one-line confirmation.

## `--auto` mode

Runs the per-item procedure above end to end with minimal live input — the
user has explicitly asked for unattended execution. Steps 10 (commit) and 11
(merge/push/cleanup) always stay live, per item, no exception: CLAUDE.md's
commit-approval rule holds even mid-pipeline. Steps not called out below run
exactly as written above.

**Invocation.** A slug/N present after stripping `--auto` runs just that
item under this mode. No slug batch-processes every READY item, in
dashboard order; any IN PROGRESS item is resumed first via the existing
step 1–2 logic; BLOCKED items are skipped by construction (never READY).
The queue is fixed at the start of the run — items added to READY mid-run
aren't picked up until a later invocation. Loop the modified per-item
procedure below across the queue.

1. **Step 3 (Branch)** — repo ambiguity (multiple named, or none) can't be
   guessed. Skip the item, queue an end-of-run digest entry noting why, and
   continue the batch.
2. **Step 4 (Baseline)** — a truly trivial failing baseline (a one-liner,
   no investigation needed) still folds in per CLAUDE.md's existing
   exception. Anything needing real investigation: draft the backlog-item
   `add` JSON for it, queue it in the digest (never add silently), skip
   implementing on top of a broken baseline, and move to the next item.
3. **Step 5 (Spec or plan)** — when loading the `spec` skill
   (`skill({ name: "spec" })`), state explicitly in the task text that this
   backlog-item run is `--auto`: if spec's own step 3 escalates into
   `grill-me` for a genuinely open design branch, tell it to run that inner
   session as `grill-me --auto` too, rather than stopping for live Q&A.
4. **Step 6 (Critique)** — no ask either way, per the updated step 6 rule:
   runs unconditionally when a gate was set, skipped when the item is
   all-mechanical.
5. **Step 7 (Handoff)** — always resolves to "same session, now," no ask —
   no dispatch to a fresh session or a different model.
6. **Steps 8–9 (Red/green, Verify)** — on failure, retry up to 2 times
   before giving up. Still failing: skip the item, queue a digest entry
   describing the failure, and continue the batch.
7. **Proactive-capture protocols** — every "offer, never do silently"
   trigger from CLAUDE.md that would otherwise fire mid-run (baseline-
   failure backlog offers, proactive backlog capture, pending-item
   tracking, rejected-idea capture) queues into the digest instead.
8. **Steps 10–11** — unchanged, always live, per item, exactly as written
   above.
9. **Step 12 (Close)** — unchanged; `review`/`approve`/`gate-pass` is
   already agent-performed self-verification against stored gate criteria,
   not a user-facing ask.

**End of run.** When the queue is exhausted (or the single item completes),
show a dashboard-style summary of every item processed — done, skipped
(with reason), or failed after retries — then walk the accumulated digest
in one pass via the `question` tool, offering each queued item exactly as
its originating CLAUDE.md protocol specifies (a backlog `add`, a
`pending add`, an `out-of-scope add`), confirming or declining each in turn.
