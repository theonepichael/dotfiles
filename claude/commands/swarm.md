name: swarm
description: "Hand READY backlog items to pi agents running in herdr tabs — a real fan-out across the queue by default, or a single item when one is named. Use when the user says 'swarm', 'swarm the backlog', 'hand this to pi', 'give <item> to a pi agent', or 'delegate to a pi worker'. Requires HERDR_ENV=1; says so and stops otherwise."
---

Launching is `claude/scripts/herdr_delegate.py`, not hand-typed `herdr`
commands. It owns the recipe and its three traps; this file owns the
conversation around it.

## 1. Preflight

```bash
test "${HERDR_ENV:-}" = 1
```

Fails? Say you are not running inside herdr and stop. Do not fall back to
anything, and never drive the UI-focused pane — it may belong to the user or
another client.

## 2. Pick the scope — ask, never assume

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/herdr_delegate.py plan
```

Returns each prefix in READY with its item count and whether it is worker-safe.

The user named an item? Go to step 3 with that slug.

Otherwise **ask via AskUserQuestion**, one option per worker-safe prefix,
labelled with its real count, recommending the first row (the plan already
orders the largest worker-safe prefix first). Never pick a prefix silently —
the user asked for a swarm, not for a guess about which project.

Show `worker_safe: false` prefixes as unavailable and say why: that prefix
names the harness repo, so a worker would be editing the code it is running.
Those go to a normal session. The script refuses them anyway; explaining beats
a bare error.

## 3. Launch

One item:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/herdr_delegate.py launch --slug <slug> [--model <model>]
```

The whole queue under a prefix:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/herdr_delegate.py launch --swarm <N> --prefix <prefix> [--model <model>]
```

`--swarm` starts **one** pi orchestrator and hands it `/backlog-item
--swarm=N`; `swarm_spawn` owns the fan-out from there. Default `N` to 3 unless
the user says otherwise.

Picking a model: check `pi --list-models <pattern>` before concluding one is
unavailable. A model can resolve for pi while being absent from
`~/.pi/agent/models.json`, because the fetched catalog in `models-store.json`
is separate — this cost a wrong answer on 2026-09-03.

## 4. Watch, do not poll

```bash
herdr agent wait <agent-name> --timeout 1800000
```

Run it in the background so the settle wakes you. It returns on the first
`idle`, `done`, or `blocked`. Then read the pane:

```bash
herdr agent read <agent-name> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

`blocked` means it wants something. Read the pane before answering, and never
answer a commit gate on the user's behalf — relay it.

If raising `--lines` reveals no more of a finished response, the agent is on
the terminal's alternate screen and those rows never entered scrollback. Ask it
to write its answer to a file and read that instead.

## 5. Report

Give the user the tab id, pane id, agent name, and what it is working. Verify
before relaying anything a worker claims — run its tests yourself rather than
repeating its summary.

## What this skill does not do

It does not orchestrate. `swarm_spawn`, `swarm_poll`, `swarm_resolve_blocked`
and `swarm_amend` live in `pi/extensions/swarm-tool.ts`, and the procedure is
`pi/prompts/backlog-item.md`'s `--swarm[=N]` section — read that file rather
than restating it here. A second copy is a second thing to drift.

## Why the recipe is a script

Three things must be exactly right, and all three were got wrong by hand on
2026-09-03:

- `PI_AGENT_UNATTENDED=1` belongs on `tab create`, not `agent start`.
  `permission-gate.ts` reads it at module load, before pi's first tool call,
  and fails closed on anything but exactly `"1"`. Without it the agent stalls
  on a permission dialog while herdr still reports it as `working`.
- `--model` reaches pi only after a bare `--`; herdr rejects it as its own
  unknown flag.
- An item whose prefix names the harness repo never goes to a worker.

That env var disarms **only** the bash permission ask. `guard-rails.ts` stays
armed for protected-path writes and the git-commit-on-main worktree policy, and
turns `rm -rf` and `sudo` into outright blocks rather than unanswerable
dialogs. The `/backlog-item` commit and merge/push gates are prompt-level asks
and still stop live — an unattended worker is not an unsupervised commit.
