name: backlog-item
description: "Runs a dev_status.py backlog item end-to-end: resolve, worktree, spec (escalating to grill-me only for a genuinely open design branch), second-opinion critique, execution handoff, TDD implement, verify, commit/merge/push gates, review+approve. Use when the user says 'work on backlog item 4', 'pick up <slug>', 'let's do the next backlog item', or otherwise names a specific item to work end-to-end. Add --auto (optionally with a slug) for an unattended single-item or full-READY-batch run — commit and merge/push gates still stop live, per item."
argument-hint: [--auto] [slug|N]
---

Work the named item to done, one step at a time. Every user-approval gate
below (`## 10`, `## 11`) stops and waits for the user — never collapse two
gates into one approval. Distinct from those: the item's own `gate` field in
`dev_status.py` (step 5, step 12) is a judgment-step verification checkpoint,
not a user-approval stop — same word, different mechanism, don't conflate
them.

Invoked with `--auto` (`/backlog-item --auto [slug|N]`)? Skip straight to
the `--auto mode` section at the end of this file instead of running the
numbered steps live.

## 1. Resolve
`python3 ~/.claude/scripts/dev_status.py show <slug|N>`. Read the full
record — never start from the dashboard's one-line summary (CLAUDE.md).
Empty context/next_steps/related_files: stop and ask the user to fill them
in; don't fabricate a plan from the title. Numeric id: note the rendered rev
for `--if-rev` on the next mutating call. related_files already names a
grill plan (`~/.claude/data/grill/<slug>-plan.md`) or a spec
(`~/.claude/data/grill/<slug>-spec.md`)? Planning and critique (steps 5–6)
are already done — skip to step 8. Worktree already has
implemented, uncommitted changes (e.g. handed back from an external
executor)? Skip straight to step 9.

## 2. Start
If not already in-progress: `dev_status.py start <slug|N>` (`--if-rev <N>`
for numeric ids).

## 3. Branch
related_files names exactly one project repo → worktree it per CLAUDE.md's
Git section: `git -C <repo> worktree add ../<repo-name>-<slug> -b <slug>`.
Reuse a worktree this session already made for this item instead of a
second one. Multiple repos, or none: ask which repo — never guess.

## 4. Baseline
Run that repo's test suite (or the most relevant targeted subset) in the
fresh worktree before touching anything (CLAUDE.md's "Baseline tests before
starting code work").

## 5. Spec or plan
Delegate to the `spec` skill (Skill tool) with the item's context/next_steps
as the task. Let it draft and save the spec end-to-end (its steps 1–4) —
including its own internal escalation to `grill-me` if a field's design is
genuinely open; `/spec`'s step 3 owns that handoff and the resume-after
entirely, there is nothing to orchestrate here. Decline spec's own step 4
generation offer — step 7 below owns the handoff decision.

Once spec records its artifact path, add it to the item's related_files if
missing (CLAUDE.md's "Plans and deliverables get a path on record"). If
`/spec` delegated into `grill-me` along the way, that session's `plan_path`
is already cited from the spec's Context field — don't also record it as a
second, competing artifact.

### Architecture capture (new modules only)

If the artifact's related_files point into a module with no
`docs/architecture/{module-slug}.md` yet in the target repo — a genuinely
new module, not routine work in an existing one; judgment call, ask if
unclear — run one more pass before continuing: draft a 300–600 word doc
covering the module's boundary/responsibility (one paragraph), key
interfaces it exposes or consumes, explicit non-goals, and known
unknowns/deferred decisions. Save it to `docs/architecture/{module-slug}.md`
in the target repo (project documentation, not `~/.claude/data/grill/`) and
reference it from the spec/plan. A later item touching the same module cites
the existing doc instead of repeating this pass — check for it first.

### Gate classification

Once the spec/plan is recorded (and after architecture capture, if it ran),
classify its concrete implementation steps: **mechanical** (a rote,
unambiguous transformation — no interpretation needed) or **judgment**
(interprets a requirement, makes a design choice, or has ambiguous
acceptance criteria). If any step is judgment, set the item's gate before
continuing:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/dev_status.py gate-set <slug|N> '{"required": true, "criteria": ["<short imperative criterion per judgment step>", "..."]}'
```

If every step is mechanical, leave the gate unset (inert by default) —
don't call `gate-set` for a step breakdown with no judgment calls in it.

## 6. Critique
Offer the `second-opinion` skill against the resulting plan or spec file.
Recommended: yes — critique the plan before committing to an executor.

## 7. Handoff
Decide who implements the plan — ask if it isn't already obvious from the
conversation:
- **Same session, now.** Trivial/small item → go to step 8 immediately.
- **Cheaper Claude session.** Now run `grill.py mark-pending-execution
  --backlog-slug <slug>` (the plan's session, with this item's slug — not
  its own resolved-topic slug) and tell the user to resume with
  `/backlog-item <slug|N>` after `/clear`. The SessionStart hook's
  `pending-plan --consume` then prints that same `/backlog-item <slug>`
  line itself, pointing the fresh session at step 1's resume path instead
  of the plan file directly.
- **opencode/GLM-5.2 — personal projects only, never at work; this user
  does not use opencode in a work context under any circumstances.**
  Confirm the model actually exists in opencode's catalog (`opencode
  models`) before invoking — don't assume the version number is right,
  dictation has flubbed it before. From the worktree, hand off
  non-interactively: `opencode run --auto -m opencode-go/glm-5.2 "Implement
  <plan path> exactly as written — TDD, run the full suite, then STOP
  without committing and report the diff."` (`--auto` is required —
  without it, opencode auto-rejects its own tool-call permission requests
  in headless mode and silently makes no progress). GLM never gets the
  commit gate. Once it reports back, tell the user to point Claude at the
  worktree to review — that resumes at step 9.

For a work-related item, only the first two options are on the table —
don't offer the opencode/GLM route at all.

## 8. Red, green
TDD in the worktree: a failing test that proves the gap the plan names,
then the minimal implementation.

## 9. Verify
Run the full suite (and lint, if present) in the worktree and show the
output — "should work" is not verification (CLAUDE.md).

## 10. Gate: commit
Show the full diff. Stop — AskUserQuestion for explicit commit approval. No
exceptions for being mid-pipeline, and no exception for code an external
executor wrote (CLAUDE.md).

## 11. Gate: commit-then-land
On approval, commit (conventional format) — this gate is never bundled with
what follows. Personal project (this repo, a personal side project — never
a `work-`-prefixed item or a work repo): offer the follow-on sequence as one
bundled question (CLAUDE.md's Git section) — "merge to main, push, and
clean up the worktree?" — then merge locally, push, `git worktree remove`,
`git branch -d` on that single approval. Work-related or ambiguous: ask
separately for merge and for push — never bundle.

## 12. Close
`dev_status.py review <slug|N>` then `approve <slug|N>` — never a bare
`done` on an in-review item. If `approve` refuses citing an unmet gate,
actually check each criterion from `show <slug|N>` against the diff — don't
pass it reflexively — then `dev_status.py gate-pass <slug|N>` and retry
`approve`. Display the full dashboard stdout these print; don't just
narrate a one-line confirmation.

## `--auto` mode

Runs the per-item procedure above end to end with minimal live input — the
user has explicitly asked for unattended execution. Steps 10 (commit) and 11
(merge/push/cleanup) always stay live, per item, no exception: CLAUDE.md's
commit-approval rule holds even mid-pipeline. Steps not called out below run
exactly as written above.

**Invocation.** `--auto <slug|N>` runs just that item under this mode.
`--auto` with no slug batch-processes every READY item, in dashboard order;
any IN PROGRESS item is resumed first via the existing step 1–2 logic;
BLOCKED items are skipped by construction (never READY). The queue is fixed
at the start of the run — items added to READY mid-run aren't picked up
until a later invocation. Loop the modified per-item procedure below across
the queue.

1. **Step 3 (Branch)** — repo ambiguity (multiple named, or none) can't be
   guessed. Skip the item, queue an end-of-run digest entry noting why, and
   continue the batch.
2. **Step 4 (Baseline)** — a truly trivial failing baseline (a one-liner,
   no investigation needed) still folds in per CLAUDE.md's existing
   exception. Anything needing real investigation: draft the backlog-item
   `add` JSON for it, queue it in the digest (never add silently), skip
   implementing on top of a broken baseline, and move to the next item.
3. **Step 5 (Spec or plan)** — when delegating to the `spec` skill (Skill
   tool), state explicitly in the task text that this backlog-item run is
   `--auto`: if spec's own step 3 escalates into `grill-me` for a
   genuinely open design branch, that inner session should also run
   `grill-me --auto` rather than stopping for live Q&A.
4. **Step 6 (Critique)** — runs unconditionally, no ask: always send the
   resulting plan/spec through `second-opinion` before implementing.
5. **Step 7 (Handoff)** — always resolves to "same session, now," no ask —
   no dispatch to a cheaper session or an external model.
6. **Steps 8–9 (Red/green, Verify)** — on failure, retry up to 2 times
   before giving up. Still failing: skip the item, queue a digest entry
   describing the failure, and continue the batch.
7. **Proactive-capture protocols** — every "offer, never do silently"
   trigger from CLAUDE.md that would otherwise fire mid-run (baseline-
   failure backlog offers, proactive backlog capture, pending-item
   tracking, rejected-idea capture) queues into the digest instead.
8. **Steps 10–11** — unchanged, always live, per item, exactly as written
   above.
9. **Step 12 (Close)** — unchanged; `review`/`approve`/`gate-pass` is
   already agent-performed self-verification against stored gate criteria,
   not a user-facing ask.

**End of run.** When the queue is exhausted (or the single item completes),
show a dashboard-style summary of every item processed — done, skipped
(with reason), or failed after retries — then walk the accumulated digest
in one pass via `AskUserQuestion`, offering each queued item exactly as its
originating CLAUDE.md protocol specifies (a backlog `add`, a `pending add`,
an `out-of-scope add`), confirming or declining each in turn.
