# ── isolation contract ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every backend invocation in this repo — adversarial critique and plain
# completion alike — must satisfy all of these. A backend meets every clause
# or it is not eligible; there is no partially-isolated tier, because a
# weaker tier becomes the working default once its warning is normalised.
#
# Why this exists: measured 2026-08-31, a critique call could write files and,
# through pi's dev_status tool, mutate the real backlog store, while every
# backend was handed the user's own instruction files — so the "outside"
# reviewer held the user's rulebook. _raise_on_emitted_tool_call below is not
# a guard against that: it catches tool-call markup leaking through as *text*
# and cannot see a real tool action.
#
# tools_execution and tools_reach are deliberately separate, because the two
# available mechanisms deliver different things and conflating them would let
# the contract claim more than it enforces. A vendor flag can remove the tools
# outright; OS containment cannot -- it leaves them running with nothing of
# yours in reach. Both clauses are mandatory either way, so this is still one
# bar: a backend satisfies each clause by one mechanism or the other, and
# containment satisfies tools_execution only in the sense that there is
# nothing left to execute against.

    ``stdin`` is always :data:`subprocess.DEVNULL`, never inherited: every
    backend here is a one-shot, non-interactive prompt, so a child never
    needs to read from our stdin. Without this, a child that reads stdin at
    all (opencode's CLI does, unconditionally, per
    ``anomalyco/opencode#38723``) inherits our own process's stdin file
    descriptor by default and blocks forever if that descriptor never

    long-lived parent process like this one hands its children) — this
    reproduced reliably in this environment and is a confirmed root cause of

            waiting up to ``timeout`` again, so worst-case wall time is

            failure mode this exists for — see ``run_opencode``). Default
