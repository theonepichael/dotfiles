"""seed_hook_subset_guard.py — refuse a commit that drops a seed's SessionStart
hook groups.

Compares the STAGED (index) versions of ``claude/settings.json`` and
``claude/settings.work.json`` against their committed (HEAD) versions and
exits 1 when a group has been lost. Wired from dotfiles' own
``githooks/pre-commit`` — a port of agent-toolkit's guard (commit 6f0ce12)
for this repo's own seed, run repo-relative, never via the live
``~/.claude/scripts`` symlink (agent-toolkit owns that destination; see
links.toml's repo-local-only comment and
test/test_link_ownership_boundary.py).

What counts as a loss
---------------------
Groups are identified by their ``matcher`` value (a missing or JSON-``null``
matcher is ``None``) and counted as a multiset. A loss is any matcher HEAD
has that staged has fewer of — including when the rewrite also adds some
other group in the same commit, which a plain set-subset test would miss.
Contents inside a group are deliberately not compared: collapsing many
entries into one wrapper command inside the matcher-less startup group is an
approved refactor shape, and per-command loss is the live drift-check's
domain.

Why staged, not the worktree file
---------------------------------
A concurrent writer can change the worktree file between a verification and
the commit — that exact race produced a committed seed that had silently
lost its matcher-'*' herdr group (a lossy rewrite by a second agent working
the same checkout). The index is what the commit will actually contain, and
git holds the index lock for the whole pre-commit hook, so this read cannot
race a concurrent ``git add``.

Escape hatch
------------
``SEED_HOOK_ALLOW_DROP=1`` skips this guard only (checked before any git or
JSON work), leaving every other check in ``githooks/pre-commit`` —
no-commit-on-main and the generated-instruction/interface checks —
untouched. It exists
because an intentional group removal must not require ``git commit
--no-verify``, which would disable those other checks too.
