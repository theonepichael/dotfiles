"""SessionStart hook + CLI: detect (and optionally fix) drift between the
live ``~/.claude/settings.json`` / ``~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`` /
(under WSL) the Windows-side VS Code ``settings.json`` and
``keybindings.json`` and their seeds in the dotfiles repo.

Why this exists
---------------
install.py's seed_file contract is copy-once: settings.json and
opencode.jsonc are written the first time install.py runs on a machine,
then never overwritten — because Claude Code and opencode both rewrite
these files in place as permissions get approved live, which would replace
a symlink with a plain file and silently detach the seed. install.py
already has helpers (``describe_settings_drift``, ``describe_opencode_drift``,
``opencode_bypass_drift``, ``json_key_drift``, ``_load_json_pair``) to report
divergence — but they only run when install.py is manually re-executed.
Nothing runs them automatically, so a live settings.json can silently drift
from the repo seed for days (this happened 2026-07-24 -> 2026-07-30). This
script closes that gap: a SessionStart hook prints a one-liner per drifted
file at the start of every Claude Code session.

What counts as drift
--------------------
A *denylist* of cosmetic keys is silently allowed to differ (per-machine
preferences). Everything else is reported as drift by default, so a
future security-relevant key Claude Code ships (``autoCompact``, ``sandbox``,
the already-shipped ``skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt``) is caught on the
first session after the schema change rather than silently ignored —
forcing a human to either silence it (add to cosmetics) or investigate.

    settings.json   cosmetic: theme, model, voice, voiceEnabled, agent,
                    tui, statusLine
                    reported: everything else (permissions, hooks, and any
                    unknown future top-level key)
    opencode.jsonc  cosmetic: $schema, agent
                    reported: everything else (permission, and any unknown
                    future top-level key); an ``xargs *`` / ``awk *``
                    bypass under ``permission.bash`` is surfaced verbatim
                    as a ``SECURITY:`` line, exactly as install.py prints
                    it.
    VS Code         no cosmetic split — every setting/keybinding is a
    settings.json / legitimate user edit, not a security-relevant key.
    keybindings.json Drift is a plain whole-file text comparison (not a
                    JSON key diff): these are legal JSONC (comments,
                    trailing commas), which ``json.loads`` can't always
                    parse, so text equality is the only signal that can't
                    misreport a commented file as drift-free. Only checked
                    under WSL, when a Windows-side ``code`` CLI is found on
                    PATH (see ``_vscode_wsl_user_dir``).

Why the helpers are vendored in-script, not imported from install.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A SessionStart hook is leaf infrastructure; importing a 1800-line
installer to reuse ~30 lines of pure drift helpers trades trivial
one-time duplication for permanent coupling — and an import failure
(any ``ImportError`` propagating from a future edit to install.py)
would silently no-op the whole hook, disconnecting the smoke detector
from its battery. The helpers below are vendored from install.py
(see the ``# vendored from install.py`` headers); keep them in sync if
install.py's drifts.

Subcommands
-----------
    check   print a one-liner per drifted file (default; the SessionStart
            hook uses this). Silent when there's nothing to report.
            Loud-fails (prints to stdout AND exits nonzero) when a file
            should be parseable but isn't — e.g. opencode.jsonc grew a
            ``//`` comment that ``json.loads`` can't read. Never pretends
            "no drift" on a parse failure. VS Code drift never loud-fails
            this way (there's no strict JSON loader for it — see above);
            its message explicitly calls out that only ``sync-to-seed``
            applies to it, not ``fix``.
    fix     additively merge drifted keys from the seed into the live
            file, preserving all live-only entries (which are almost
            certainly live approvals). Does NOT cover VS Code — the
            reported VS Code drift problem only ever runs in the
            live->seed direction (a Windows Settings-UI edit not making it
            back into the repo), and shipping the reverse direction here
            would mean an unenforced clobber risk: a native Windows VS
            Code window open at fix-time could silently overwrite the fix
            on its own next save, and detecting a running native Windows
            process from WSL is out of scope. Push a repo-side VS Code
            edit to Windows via install.py's existing copy-once
            ``seed_file`` instead, once the live file is deleted:

            * ``permissions.allow``: union — append seed entries not in
              live; never remove live entries.
            * ``permissions.deny`` / ``permissions.ask``: overwrite from
              seed only when live is a *weakened subset* (live has fewer
              entries than the seed — a security regression); otherwise
              preserve live.
            * ``permission.bash`` (opencode): union of seed patterns into
              live; never remove live patterns — **except** the
              ``xargs *`` / ``awk *`` allowlist bypasses, which are
              stripped from live even under additive policy.
            * ``hooks``: wholesale-overwrite from seed (hooks are not
              live-modified by approval flows, so any divergence is
              genuine drift).
            * Any key that exists in both but differs in a way that isn't
              one of the above is *flag-and-skip*: printed, not touched.

            Backs up the prior live file to
            ``<path>.bak.YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`` first; writes atomically
            (tmp + ``os.replace`` in the same dir, defense in depth
            against torn reads). Refuses to run while any Claude Code
            session is active — Claude Code holds settings in memory
            for the session's lifetime and serializes its in-memory state
            on every approval, so a mid-session fix gets silently
            clobbered on the next approval and SessionStart never re-fires
            (the session never restarted). Close your Claude Code
            sessions, then run ``fix``.
    sync-to-seed
            the reverse direction: mirror live settings back into the
            dotfiles seed. For a live-first edit (e.g. testing a
            SessionStart hook fix immediately in
            ``~/.claude/settings.json``) that needs forwarding into git.

            * ``hooks``: wholesale-mirrored live->seed (same rationale as
              fix()'s seed->live direction — hooks aren't live-modified by
              approval flows, so any divergence is genuine drift).
            * ``permissions`` / opencode's ``permission.*``: never
              written, only reported — live approvals are often
              profile-specific, so a live-only entry isn't necessarily
              drift to repair.
            * VS Code's ``settings.json`` / ``keybindings.json``: this is
              where VS Code drift actually gets repaired (``fix`` doesn't
              cover it — see above). Whole-file text copy, not a JSON
              round-trip, so it can't fail on native JSONC and can't
              silently reformat the user's file.

            No active-session guard needed (unlike ``fix``) — this only
            writes the seed file, never the live files Claude Code/
            opencode hold in memory. Same backup-then-atomic-write pattern
            as ``fix``. Accepts ``--dotfiles-root PATH`` to target a
            worktree instead of ``~/dotfiles`` (the default) — point it at
            a fresh worktree per the dotfiles-first git policy rather than
            writing directly into the main checkout.

Usage
-----
    settings_seed_drift_check.py           # check (default)
    settings_seed_drift_check.py check
    settings_seed_drift_check.py fix
    settings_seed_drift_check.py sync-to-seed [--dotfiles-root PATH]

Exits 0 from ``check`` when there is no drift and no parse failure;
exits nonzero from ``check`` on a parse failure (so the user notices),
but never blocks the session otherwise. ``fix`` exits 1 when it refused
to run (active sessions) or hit a parse failure, 0 otherwise.
``sync-to-seed`` exits 1 on a parse failure or a ``--dotfiles-root`` that
doesn't exist, 0 otherwise.
