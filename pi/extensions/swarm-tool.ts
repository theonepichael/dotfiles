// Registers swarm_spawn / swarm_poll / swarm_resolve_blocked -- lets a pi
// session process several READY dev_status.py backlog items concurrently by
// spawning one recursive pi worker per item in its own herdr tab, pooling
// completion via herdr's socket API. Design, decisions, and three rounds of
// /second-opinion critique: ~/.claude/data/grill/2026-09-01-pi-side-agent-swarm-orchestratio-plan.md
// and its -critique-notes.md companion.
//
// The herdr mechanics below (agent_status JSON shape, --until repetition,
// send-keys navigation) were verified against a real live blocked agent
// during implementation, not just inferred from `herdr --skill`'s docs --
// four real gaps surfaced that way and are fixed in this file:
//   1. `--until` must be repeated per state; a comma-joined list is a CLI
//      usage error (exit 2), not silently accepted.
//   2. herdr's pi integration (herdr-agent-state.ts) reports "blocked" only
//      when told to via a `herdr:blocked` event -- it does no screen
//      detection once its lifecycle hook is authoritative. Nothing in this
//      repo emitted that event before this change; question-tool.ts now
//      does (see that file), and backlog-item.md's commit/merge-push gates
//      were updated to go through it instead of "ask in plain text" (which
//      just ends the turn -- indistinguishable from finishing).
//   3. `agent prompt` refuses an agent already `blocked` (`agent_blocked`
//      error) -- it cannot be used to answer a picker.
//   4. There is no `agent send-text`; answering a blocked picker means
//      driving it via `agent send-keys` arrow-key navigation (confirmed:
//      "down"/"up" move the rendered `>` marker, "enter" submits).
//
// A fifth gap surfaced later, live, on a real multi-item swarm run: an
// earlier version of swarm_poll raced every active worker's `herdr agent
// wait` call and ABORTED every non-winner the instant any one settled --
// including workers that were still genuinely active or had just reached a
// real blocked state. `pi.exec`'s underlying execCommand (dist/core/exec.js)
// always RESOLVES, even on abort, coercing a signal-killed process's null
// exit code to 0 -- so a killed wait call could resolve with exitCode 0 and
// empty stdout, which fell into classifyWaitResult's old fallback bucket
// and got reported as a false timed_out. Confirmed live: a worker that had
// actually finished successfully (dev_status.py showed status: done) and
// another that had reached a genuine blocked question were both misreported
// this way. Fix: no aborting at all. Each active worker gets exactly one
// long-running `agent wait` call, armed once and never killed -- losers of
// a race just keep running toward their own --timeout, feeding a shared
// per-run event queue as they naturally resolve. classifyWaitResult also no
// longer folds every non-timeout nonzero exit into "timed_out" -- only
// herdr's own `{"error":{"code":"timeout"}}` (on stderr) counts as a real
// timeout; anything else (agent_not_found, a crash, an unparseable
// response) is reported as "error" instead, with the raw detail attached,
// rather than silently mislabeled as a timeout that never happened.
//
// A sixth surfaced on the first end-to-end shakedown, and it is why the wait
// path now looks the way it does. swarm_poll treated an elapsed wait as a
// dead worker: `finished`, `timed_out` and `error` all fell into the same
// `else` branch, which closed the tab and dropped the worker. But an elapsed
// wait means NOTHING SETTLED IN THE WINDOW, which is exactly what a healthy
// worker doing several minutes of real work looks like -- herdr documents
// `agent wait` as a wait deadline, not a liveness check. A worker several
// minutes into a real item (item claimed, worktree created, spec written, a
// four-criterion gate set) was destroyed the moment the deadline elapsed,
// costing its in-flight context and everything it had written inside its
// worktree, and leaving an orphaned worktree, a stale claim blocking a later
// start, and a digest line reporting it as having misbehaved. The 30-minute
// constant's old comment -- "matching --auto's generous per-step
// conventions" -- was the bug in miniature: the wait is armed once per
// WORKER and covers the whole item, not one step.
//
// The fix separates two durations that were conflated. `timeoutMs` is a
// CHECK-IN INTERVAL: when it elapses, `agent get` is asked whether the
// worker is alive, and a live one is simply waited on again and reported as
// `still_working`. `workerDeadlineMs` is the whole-item budget, measured in
// WORKING time so hours parked awaiting a human relay do not count, and it
// is the only thing that stops a live worker. Two rules keep the probe from
// re-deriving the original bug one layer down: it fails OPEN, so only
// herdr's own `agent_not_found` closes a worker and every inconclusive
// answer re-arms; and the budget bounds those inconclusive answers too, so a
// worker wedged badly enough that `agent get` itself cannot answer is still
// stopped rather than re-arming forever. A stop reports whether liveness was
// actually confirmed, because saying "still working" about a worker whose
// probe failed would be the same class of lie as the mislabeled timeout that
// started all this.

 * Marks a worker's tab as unattended, read by both gate extensions at module
 * load.
 *
 * Pi ships no permission system of its own (docs/usage.md's Design
 * Principles: "it intentionally does not include ... permission popups").
 * This repo supplies two: permission-gate.ts confirms bash outside its
 * allowlist, guard-rails.ts confirms `rm -rf` and `sudo`. Both raise
 * `ctx.ui.confirm`, and a worker's `ctx.hasUI` is true because it really is a
 * TUI -- one with nobody in front of it. The worker then waits forever while
 * `agent_status` still reads "working", so swarm_poll sees progress and the
 * orchestrator relays nothing. Observed live on 2026-09-02, twice.
 *
 * Passing this at tab creation replaces a slash-command handshake that tried
 * to talk one gate down after the fact and then prove it had worked, with a
 * token, an ack file, a poll and a 15-second deadline. The environment is set
 * before pi starts, so there is no prompt to deliver, nothing to time out,
 * and no window in which a worker holds real work while still armed. It also
 * sidesteps the reason that handshake could only ever cover one gate: pi
 * loads each extension separately, so a session-wide switch cannot be shared
 * between them in module state -- /trust-session tried exactly that and is a
 * proven no-op. An environment variable each gate reads for itself has no
 * such failure mode.
 *
 * The two gates draw DIFFERENT conclusions from it, on purpose:
 *   - permission-gate.ts allows. Its "ask" tier is everything outside a
 *     narrow allowlist, and a worker that cannot run tests or git is useless.
 *     This is what the swarm already did by sending /permission-gate-disable.
 *   - guard-rails.ts blocks. `rm -rf` and `sudo` are refused with a reason
 *     the worker can read, rather than asked about. Every other guard-rails
 *     rule -- protected-path writes, the git-commit-on-main worktree policy
 *     -- stays armed in a worker exactly as in an attended session.
 *
 * So this is not a blanket grant of autonomy. It is the statement "no human
 * will answer a dialog here", which is simply true of a swarm worker.

   * Holding the entry, by contrast, makes the release depend on some later
   * code path running. A rejected `tab close`, an event whose worker is
   * already out of state, or an earlier event in the same batch throwing
   * would each leave the entry held forever on a worker still in
   * `state.workers`: active, holding a slot, with no wait running and
