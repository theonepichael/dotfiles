// Registers swarm_spawn / swarm_poll / swarm_resolve_blocked -- lets a pi
// session process several READY dev_status.py backlog items concurrently by
// spawning one recursive pi worker per item in its own herdr pane, pooling
// completion via herdr's socket API. Design, decisions, and three rounds of
// /second-opinion critique: ~/.claude/data/grill/2026-09-01-pi-side-agent-swarm-orchestratio-plan.md
// and its -critique-notes.md companion.
//
// The herdr mechanics below (agent_status JSON shape, --until repetition,
// send-keys navigation) were verified against a real live blocked agent
// during implementation, not just inferred from `herdr --skill`'s docs --
// four real gaps surfaced that way and are fixed in this file:
//   1. `--until` must be repeated per state; a comma-joined list is a CLI
//      usage error (exit 2), not silently accepted.
//   2. herdr's pi integration (herdr-agent-state.ts) reports "blocked" only
//      when told to via a `herdr:blocked` event -- it does no screen
//      detection once its lifecycle hook is authoritative. Nothing in this
//      repo emitted that event before this change; question-tool.ts now
//      does (see that file), and backlog-item.md's commit/merge-push gates
//      were updated to go through it instead of "ask in plain text" (which
//      just ends the turn -- indistinguishable from finishing).
//   3. `agent prompt` refuses an agent already `blocked` (`agent_blocked`
//      error) -- it cannot be used to answer a picker.
//   4. There is no `agent send-text`; answering a blocked picker means
//      driving it via `agent send-keys` arrow-key navigation (confirmed:
//      "down"/"up" move the rendered `>` marker, "enter" submits).
//
// A fifth gap surfaced later, live, on a real multi-item swarm run: an
// earlier version of swarm_poll raced every active worker's `herdr agent
// wait` call and ABORTED every non-winner the instant any one settled --
// including workers that were still genuinely active or had just reached a
// real blocked state. `pi.exec`'s underlying execCommand (dist/core/exec.js)
// always RESOLVES, even on abort, coercing a signal-killed process's null
// exit code to 0 -- so a killed wait call could resolve with exitCode 0 and
// empty stdout, which fell into classifyWaitResult's old fallback bucket
// and got reported as a false timed_out. Confirmed live: a worker that had
// actually finished successfully (dev_status.py showed status: done) and
// another that had reached a genuine blocked question were both misreported
// this way. Fix: no aborting at all. Each active worker gets exactly one
// long-running `agent wait` call, armed once and never killed -- losers of
// a race just keep running toward their own --timeout, feeding a shared
// per-run event queue as they naturally resolve. classifyWaitResult also no
// longer folds every non-timeout nonzero exit into "timed_out" -- only
// herdr's own `{"error":{"code":"timeout"}}` (on stderr) counts as a real
// timeout; anything else (agent_not_found, a crash, an unparseable
// response) is reported as "error" instead, with the raw detail attached,
// rather than silently mislabeled as a timeout that never happened.
