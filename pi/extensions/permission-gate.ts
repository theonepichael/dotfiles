// Ported from opencode.jsonc's `permission.bash` block (the same allowlist
// opencode reads today) — one house source of truth for "which bash
// commands are safe to run without asking," re-expressed for Pi's
// tool_call event instead of opencode's declarative permission config
// (which has no Pi equivalent: Pi ships no built-in permission-prompt
// system at all — docs/usage.md's Design Principles: "it intentionally
// does not include built-in MCP, sub-agents, permission popups, plan mode,
// to-dos, or background bash").
//
// Only bash is gated here, matching opencode.jsonc's actual current scope
// (no deny entries exist there today, only allow + a "*": "ask" default) —
// opencode.jsonc's separate `external_directory` permission type has no
// direct Pi analog (Pi's file tools have no comparable directory-scoped
// gate) and is out of scope for this port.
//
// Deliberate divergence from opencode.jsonc: the scripts that now have a
// native Pi tool are NOT allowlisted here, unlike every other harness's
// permission config. dev_status.py, grill.py, second_opinion.py,
// standup.py, to_tickets_runner.py and vitals_promotion.py are each
// wrapped by an extension in pi/extensions/ that replaces raw bash calls
// entirely -- leaving the bash pattern on the allowlist would let the
// model bypass the tool silently.
// Dropping to the "*": "ask" default instead makes a direct bash call
// require confirmation (or fail outright in headless mode), pushing
// actual usage toward the tool. The tool's own internal pi.exec calls
// are unaffected -- they never go through the tool_call event this gate
// hooks, since they're plain subprocess calls from already-running
// extension code, not a model-invoked "bash" tool call.

/**
 * Whether this pi session runs with no human watching it.
 *
 * A swarm worker lives in a herdr tab nobody is looking at, so a confirmation
 * dialog there is a question addressed to no one -- the worker waits forever
 * while `agent_status` still reads "working". So the gate is never armed in
 * such a session, rather than armed and then talked down: swarm-tool.ts
 * spawns each worker tab with `herdr tab create --env PI_AGENT_UNATTENDED=1`,
 * and this is read at module load, before the first tool_call can arrive.
 *
 * This replaces a slash-command handshake (a token, an acknowledgement file,
 * a poll and a deadline) that had to prove the gate came down after the fact.
 * There is nothing to prove now: no prompt to deliver, nothing to time out,
 * and no window in which a worker has been handed work while still armed.
 *
 * What "unattended" means is each gate's own decision, and the two differ on
 * purpose. Here it means allow: this gate's "ask" tier is everything outside
 * a narrow allowlist, and a worker that cannot run tests or git is no worker
 * at all. That is also exactly what the swarm already did by sending
 * /permission-gate-disable, so it is not a new grant. guard-rails.ts reaches
 * the opposite conclusion for the commands it guards -- it blocks them rather
 * than asking -- and keeps every one of its non-interactive rules armed.
 *
 * It fails closed. Anything but exactly "1" -- unset, empty, "0", "true" --
 * leaves the gate armed, so an ordinary interactive session is unaffected and
 * a typo in the variable name cannot silently disarm anything.
 *
 * Read here rather than shared from one module: pi loads each extension
 * separately, and a value imported across extension files does not reliably
 * reach the loaded instance (see guard-rails.ts, which reads the same
 * variable for itself).
